<p> I am a junior at <a href="http://www.luther.edu/">Luther College</a>. My college is located in the vibrant town of <a href="http://www.decoraharea.com/"> Decorah </a>in northeastern Iowa, Luther is an undergraduate liberal arts college affiliated with the Lutheran Church (ELCA). </p>

<h3>A Place of Welcome</h3>

<p> Luther values its heritage. It was founded in 1861 by <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegians">Norwegian immigrants </a>-just as it values the diversity of its students, staff, and faculty, who hail from many different faith backgrounds and heritages. </p>
